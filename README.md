## What is SAWRON?

SAWRON is a powerful knowledge distillation application that transforms diverse content sources into structured, actionable insights using advanced AI. You have complete control over your data processing - choose between **local AI processing** for maximum privacy or **online AI providers** for enhanced capabilities. The application runs locally on your machine, but you decide where the AI processing happens.

### Core Purpose

SAWRON distills complex information from various sources into clear, numbered insights that help you:
- **Connect scattered information** across different content types
- **Fill knowledge gaps** with AI-powered analysis and research
- **Build a searchable knowledge base** of distilled insights
- **Choose your privacy level** - use local AI models or online providers based on your needs

## Configuration

### AI Providers

SAWRON supports multiple AI providers, giving you the flexibility to choose based on your privacy needs and performance requirements:

#### ü¶ô Ollama (Local Processing - Maximum Privacy)
**Free, runs locally, no API keys needed, data never leaves your machine**

```bash
# Install Ollama
brew install ollama  # macOS
# or download from https://ollama.ai

# Start service and pull a model
ollama serve
ollama pull phi3:mini
```

#### ‚òÅÔ∏è Online Providers (Enhanced Capabilities)
**More powerful models, faster processing, requires API keys, data sent to provider**
- **OpenAI**: Get API key from [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
- **Anthropic**: Get API key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/)
- **Google**: Get API key from [makersuite.google.com](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
- **Grok**: Get API key from [console.x.ai](https://console.x.ai/)
- **DeepSeek**: Get API key from [platform.deepseek.com](https://platform.deepseek.com/)

### Configuration Steps
1. Open SAWRON in your browser
2. Click the Settings button (‚öôÔ∏è)
3. **Choose your processing approach**:
   - **Local**: Select Ollama for privacy-first processing
   - **Online**: Choose OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Grok, or DeepSeek for enhanced capabilities
4. Enter your API key (for online providers) or configure Ollama endpoint (for local)
5. Select your preferred model
6. Test the connection and save

## Privacy & Data Control

SAWRON gives you complete control over how your data is processed:

### üîí Local Processing (Ollama)
- **Maximum Privacy**: Your content never leaves your machine
- **No API Keys**: No external accounts or subscriptions needed
- **Offline Capable**: Works without internet connection
- **Trade-off**: May be slower and less capable than online models

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Online Processing (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **Enhanced Capabilities**: Access to the most powerful AI models
- **Faster Processing**: Optimized online infrastructure
- **Regular Updates**: Always access to latest model improvements
- **Trade-off**: Your content is sent to the AI provider for processing

**Your Choice**: Switch between providers anytime based on your current needs - use local for sensitive content and online for enhanced capabilities.
