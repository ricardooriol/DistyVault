## What is SAWRON?

SAWRON is a powerful knowledge distillation platform that transforms diverse content sources into structured, actionable insights using advanced AI. You have complete control over your data processing - choose between **local AI processing** for maximum privacy or **online AI providers** for enhanced capabilities. The application runs locally on your machine, but you decide where the AI processing happens.

### Core Purpose

SAWRON distills complex information from various sources into clear, numbered insights that help you:
- **Connect scattered information** across different content types
- **Fill knowledge gaps** with AI-powered analysis and research
- **Build a searchable knowledge base** of distilled insights
- **Choose your privacy level** - use local AI models or online providers based on your needs
