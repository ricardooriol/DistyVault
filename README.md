## What is DistyVault?

DistyVault is a powerful knowledge distillation platform that transforms diverse content sources into structured, actionable documents using advanced AI. You have complete control over your data processing, being able to choose between **local AI processing** for maximum privacy or **online AI providers** for enhanced capabilities. The application runs locally on your machine, but you decide where the AI processing happens.

### Core Purpose

DistyVault distills complex information from various sources into clear, numbered insights that help you:

- **Connect scattered information** across different content types
- **Fill knowledge gaps** with AI-powered analysis and research
- **Build a searchable knowledge base** of distilled insights
