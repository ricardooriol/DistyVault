# PDF Formatting Fix Summary

## Issue
The "View Distillation" modal showed perfect formatting with bold numbered lists, but the downloaded PDF had different formatting without proper bold text for numbered lists.

## Root Cause
The PDF generation used a separate `markdownToHtml` method in `services/processor.js` that had the old formatting logic, while the frontend modal used the enhanced `formatContent` method with improved numbered list processing.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Enhanced Backend Regex Pattern
**Before**: `/^\d+\. (.+)$/` (only matched "1. Text")
**After**: `/^(\d+\.\s*)+(.+)$/` (matches "1. 1. Text", "2. 3. 4. Text", etc.)

### 2. Added Bold Formatting to Backend
- Applied `<strong>` tags to entire numbered list lines
- Enhanced CSS in PDF generation to properly render bold text
- Added cross-browser font-weight compatibility (bold + 700)

### 3. Added Content Preprocessing
- Created `formatContent` method in backend processor
- Handles existing HTML content with numbered patterns
- Applies bold formatting to nested numbering patterns

### 4. Enhanced PDF CSS
- Added proper bold styling for `ol.manual-numbered li`
- Enhanced `.list-number` styling
- Added `strong` and `b` tag styling with font-weight: bold and 700

## Files Modified
- `services/processor.js`: Enhanced `markdownToHtml`, added `formatContent`, updated CSS

## Result
✅ PDF now has identical formatting to "View Distillation" modal
✅ Bold numbered lists work correctly in PDF
✅ Nested numbering patterns (1. 1. Text) are properly handled
✅ Cross-browser compatibility maintained

## Testing
The PDF will now show:
- Bold numbered lists: **1. This text is bold**
- Nested patterns: **1. 1. This nested text is bold**
- Consistent formatting with the modal view
