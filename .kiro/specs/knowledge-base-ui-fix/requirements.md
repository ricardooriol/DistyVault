# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses a UI layout issue where action buttons on knowledge base items become inaccessible when the knowledge base contains many items. The buttons on the right side of each item get cut off or pushed outside the visible area, preventing users from accessing important functionality like viewing summaries, raw content, or deleting items.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user with many items in my knowledge base, I want to be able to access all action buttons for each item, so that I can manage my knowledge base effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the knowledge base contains multiple items THEN all action buttons SHALL remain visible and accessible
2. WHEN the viewport width is reduced THEN action buttons SHALL adapt to maintain accessibility
3. WHEN hovering over knowledge base items THEN action buttons SHALL be clearly visible and clickable
4. WHEN the knowledge base list is scrolled THEN action buttons SHALL remain properly positioned

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user on different screen sizes, I want the knowledge base interface to be responsive, so that I can use the application effectively on various devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the application on mobile devices THEN action buttons SHALL be accessible through appropriate interaction patterns
2. WHEN using the application on tablet devices THEN the layout SHALL optimize space usage while maintaining button accessibility
3. WHEN using the application on desktop devices THEN action buttons SHALL be clearly visible without horizontal scrolling
4. WHEN the browser window is resized THEN the interface SHALL adapt gracefully

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user managing a large knowledge base, I want consistent and intuitive access to item actions, so that I can efficiently work with my content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any knowledge base item THEN the action buttons SHALL be consistently positioned
2. WHEN the item title or content is long THEN it SHALL NOT interfere with action button visibility
3. WHEN multiple items are displayed THEN each item's actions SHALL be clearly associated with that specific item
4. WHEN performing actions on items THEN the UI SHALL provide clear feedback and maintain layout stability
