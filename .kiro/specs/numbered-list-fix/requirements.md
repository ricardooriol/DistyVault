# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The numbered list display functionality in the SAWRON application is currently broken. All numbered list items display "1." instead of sequential numbering (1., 2., 3., 4., etc.). This affects the readability and usability of processed content summaries. The requirement is to fix the numbered list display to show proper sequential numbering with black bold styling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user viewing processed content summaries, I want numbered lists to display sequential numbering (1., 2., 3., 4., etc.), so that I can easily follow the logical order of items.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views a summary containing numbered lists THEN the system SHALL display sequential numbers (1., 2., 3., 4., etc.) instead of all "1."
2. WHEN multiple numbered lists exist in the same content THEN each list SHALL start numbering from 1 and increment sequentially within that list
3. WHEN a numbered list is interrupted by other content THEN a new numbered list SHALL restart numbering from 1

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user viewing numbered lists, I want the numbers to be styled with black bold text without background decorations, so that they are clearly visible and professional looking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN numbered list items are displayed THEN the numbers SHALL be rendered in black bold text
2. WHEN numbered list items are displayed THEN the numbers SHALL NOT have any background color or border
3. WHEN numbered list items are displayed THEN the numbers SHALL be properly aligned with the list content

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the numbered list fix to work consistently across all browsers and devices, so that the experience is reliable regardless of my platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the numbered list is viewed in different browsers THEN the sequential numbering SHALL work consistently
2. WHEN the page is refreshed or cached THEN the numbered list display SHALL remain functional
3. WHEN CSS is loaded THEN the numbered list styles SHALL override any browser default behaviors

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the numbered list implementation to be maintainable and debuggable, so that future issues can be easily identified and resolved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN debugging numbered lists THEN the HTML structure SHALL be clearly identifiable with appropriate class names
2. WHEN CSS changes are made THEN the numbered list styles SHALL be isolated and not affect other list types
3. WHEN the JavaScript generates numbered lists THEN the counter logic SHALL be reliable and reset properly between lists
